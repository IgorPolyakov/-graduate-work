The aim of this work is the development of software (software) to evaluate the deformation of surfaces of solids, as well as research methods and algorithms on artificial and on real optical images.

The influence of the method of interpolation iterative approach with sub-pixel accuracy in the calculation of the optical flow (vector field), and the influence of pre-imaging to build fields of displacement vectors.

Investigate methods for finding the displacement of more than 20px.

 

The project was implemented using the following development tools: the programming language C ++ (Qt), development environment QtCreator 3, Sublime 3. A version control system git.

The software, developed in the course of this work, presented in the annex.

The report is made in accordance with the OS TUSUR 01-2013 using a word processor \LaTeX.
