FIELD DISPLACEMENT VECTOR, STRAIN COMPONENTS, SUB-PIXEL ACCURACY

The aim of this work is the development of software (software) to evaluate the deformation of surfaces of solids, as well as research methods and algorithms on model, and the real optical images.

The influence of the method of interpolation image with sub-pixel precision using an iterative approach to the calculation of the optical flow (vector field).


The project was implemented using the following development tools: the programming language C ++ (Qt), development environment QtCreator 3, Sublime 3. A version control system git.

The software, developed in the course of this work, presented in the annex.

The report is made in accordance with the OS TUSUR 01-2013 using a word processor \LaTeX.
